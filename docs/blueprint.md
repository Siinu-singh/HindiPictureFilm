## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#FD5E1E) to reflect Bollywood's energetic and dramatic style, contrasting well against dark backgrounds.
- Background color: Dark charcoal (#050505) to create a modern, immersive cinematic experience. A light mode alternative would use very light gray (#f5f5f5).
- Accent color: Electric blue (#0165b9), as this lies close to the primary on the color wheel but still provides significant contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean interface complemented by a secondary, Bollywood-style custom font, as requested by the user, to capture Bollywood aesthetics.
- Glassmorphism effects on the sticky navbar to provide a modern, frosted glass look that enhances UI elements without obscuring content.
- 3D card tilt and shadow effects, scroll-triggered animations, and animated text fades to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.
